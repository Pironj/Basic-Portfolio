        <p id="about-text">I'm a midwest transplant who recently decided to switch careers.  I currently am working in the food & beverage industry and took a step down from my role as a director of operationsto dedicate myself to going back to school.  I am a people person and tend to be very easy going.  I get along well with my peers and thrive when problem solving collaboratively as well as on solo projects.  I have managed four separate businesses grossing over $4M in annual revenu.  I have gained the respect of my employees and treat everyone fairly and with respect. I am very much lookingforward to collaborating with like minded individuals on new problems in my future career. Intro into discovering UW's Coding Bootcamp for full-stack web development and jumpstarted my progress into a new career.  I have dabbled with code in the past and decided to take the plunge and get the ball rolling for myself and my family.</p>
        <p id="about-text2">I am newly and happily married, and very excited to be starting this next chapter in my life. My wife and I have a goal to move to Hawaii while we are still young.  I am animal lover and care for two fur babies currently, but soon to be more in the future.</p>
